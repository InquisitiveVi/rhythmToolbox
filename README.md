rhythmToolbox
=============

ClockLab -like Matlab functions for chronobiological analysis

Run "actiBox_cmdLine.m" to perform the analysis on sample input data from Vivago wrist actigraph. 

Kind of beta release without any GUI if someone finds them useful, as they have not been developed for some time.
